Follow the flow of execution in the following programs and predict what will happen for each
one
---------------------------------------
Example 1
---------------------------------------
a = input("What... is your quest")
b = "to seek the holy grail"
if a != b:
    print("Go On. Off you go")
else:
    b = input("What...is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?")
    if b == "What do you mean? An African or European swallow?":
        print("I don't know that...AHHH [Bridgekeeper was thrown over bridge]")
    else:
        print("[you were thrown over bridge]")

Prediction: 
The program asks for one's quest. If their input is to seek the holy grail, the program will say to go on.
If they are not seeking the grail, they are asked for the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow.
If they ask to be more specific, the bridgekeeper won't know. Else, the program says the person was thrown over.

Actual:
Mostly the same, but the program jumps to the question on swallows if you are seeking the holy grail, and any other answer lets you through.

---------------------------------------
Example 2
---------------------------------------
user_input = input("What is your favorite color")
if user_input == 'blue':
    print("Blueskadoo")
elif user_input == "red":
    print("Roses are red!")
elif user_input == "yellow":
    print("Mellow Yellow")
elif user_input == "green":
    print("Green Machine")
elif user_input == "orange":
    print("Orange you glad I didn't say banana.")
elif user_input == "black":
    print("I see a red door and I want it painted black")
elif user_input == "purple":
    print("And we'll never be royalllssss")
elif user_input == "pink":
    print("Pinky- and the Brain")
else:
    print("I don't recognize that color. Is it even...??")

Prediction: 
Whatever color is picked will send back a message related to that color. 
If that color isn't listed, the program returns it doesn't recognize that color.

Actual: 
Same as prediction.
